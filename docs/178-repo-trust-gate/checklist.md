# Repo trust gate — checklist

## Decisions locked
- [x] Agent-while-untrusted: **option (a)** — allow chat, gate only auto-exec (install + compose)
- [x] Trust key: reuse `canonicalRepoKey()` (git-utils.ts); do NOT use raw URL or `parseGitHubRemote()` (null for non-GitHub remotes → shared key)
- [x] Persistence home: `RepoStore` `trusted` column (no dedicated store)
- [x] No-remote local sessions: **trusted by construction** (locally authored)
- [x] Re-prompt policy on remote change / `shipit.yaml` rewrite: **don't** — TOFU trusts the remote identity; documented as a known limitation

## Server
- [x] Trusted-remotes persistence (`isTrusted`/`setTrusted`, `trusted` column) keyed by `canonicalRepoKey(url)`
- [x] Non-GitHub remotes get a distinct trust key (`canonicalRepoKey` is defined for every remote, unlike `parseGitHubRemote`) — covered by the per-remote isolation unit test
- [x] Mark ShipIt template-created repos trusted at creation
- [x] Gate warm pre-install (`runPreInstall`) behind trust — the pre-open path
- [x] Gate `runInstall()` (on-activation, via `setupServiceManager`) behind trust; defer until acceptance
- [x] Gate auto-preview compose `command:`/`build:` startup behind trust (same `setupServiceManager` early-return)
- [x] Accept-trust action: `POST /api/repos/trust` that unblocks + runs deferred startup
- [x] On acceptance: warm/pre-install (`warmSessionForRepo`), re-run deferred setup for open sessions (`runner.rerunServiceSetup`), broadcast updated repo list
- [x] **Trust loop must enumerate the runner registry, not `sessionManager.list()`.** A just-claimed session stays warm (`warm = 1`) until its first turn graduates it, and `list()` filters warm out (`WHERE warm = 0`) — so a user who trusts *before* sending a first turn (the common case) had their open session skipped: `rerunServiceSetup` never fired, the deferred install/compose never ran, and the preview stayed empty (no service list AND no `compose_not_configured` "add shipit.yaml" hint) until a brand-new session was opened. Fixed by iterating `runnerRegistry.ids()` (warm sessions still have a live runner) and resolving each via `sessionManager.get(id)`. Regression test in `repos.test.ts`.

## Client
- [x] Inline trust consent (`RepoTrustBanner`) for untrusted remotes (no link-out, no modal escape) — rendered as the Preview tab's restricted empty state: a centered card overlaying the (empty) preview frame, visible only on the Preview tab
- [x] Wire accept action (`trustRepo` store action); reflect trusted state from the repo's `trusted` flag; persists in RepoStore so it doesn't recur per session
- [x] Show the banner *before the first turn* on a freshly-added/claimed repo. `App.tsx` keyed the banner off `currentSession?.remoteUrl`, but a just-claimed session stays **warm** (`warm=1`) until its first turn graduates it, and `SessionManager.list()` excludes warm sessions — so `currentSession` (and thus `currentRepoUrl`) was undefined and the banner silently bailed, leaving only the misleading "Installing dependencies" startup overlay until the first agent turn. Fixed by falling back to the `/{slug}/new` route's repo: `currentRepoUrl = currentSession?.remoteUrl ?? newSessionRepoUrl`.

## Tests
- [x] Untrusted clone does NOT run `agent.install` / start compose on activation (`setupServiceManager` gate unit test)
- [x] Acceptance lets setup proceed (trusted control case in the same test)
- [x] Trust cached per remote — `RepoStore` unit tests (canonical identity, per-remote isolation, persistence across instances)
- [x] Repo added by URL is untrusted by default; `POST /api/repos/trust` trusts it (repos integration test)
- [x] Client banner shows for untrusted / hides for trusted / accept clears it
- [x] Warm pre-install executor covered against a real worker stub (`warm-pool-preinstall.test.ts`): forwards the repo's resolved `agent.install` to `/install`, and — the gate's intent at the helper level — **never touches the worker when there is no install config**. The full standby-level "untrusted *added* repo skips warm pre-install" assertion remains structural (the `isTrusted` gate sits in the standby callback; covered by the `repoStore.isTrusted` unit tests + warm flow staying green), since a worker-call assertion there needs the full standby+container harness.

## Docs
- [x] Add a tracker `issue:` pointer to frontmatter (SHI-96)
- [x] Note the trust gate in `src/server/shipit-docs/preview.md` (agent-visible startup behavior)
