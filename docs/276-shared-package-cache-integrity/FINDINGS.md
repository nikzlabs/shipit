title: Store-in-overlay measurements (docs/276)
description: Docker-mounted measurements that gate the pnpm store-in-overlay fix — attack isolation (H4 and H2, each with a control), copy-up disk, install time, and their limits.

# Findings — pnpm store inside an overlay

The Docker-mounted measurements that [plan.md](./plan.md) section 5 and the
[checklist](./checklist.md) leave open, run by
[`store-overlay-spike.sh`](./store-overlay-spike.sh). They cannot run in a
session container (no Docker socket); these were run on the **services** host.

**Host:** Docker 29.7.2, `overlayfs` storage driver, Ubuntu 24.04, ext4 root,
4 vCPU / 8 GB. pnpm 12.4.2 (store layout `v11`), from a baked image so no
container re-downloads pnpm. Date 2026-09-18.

The harness **hard-asserts** the facts each cell depends on and exits non-zero on
any failure, so a silently no-op attack, a failed control, or a failed install
cannot read as a pass. "Clean" means the installed file's sha512 **equals** the
original blob's digest — not merely readable and lacking a marker; "poison" means
the marker is present **and** the digest differs; the no-overlay control **must**
poison the victim. It reported **PASS=13 FAIL=0**.

## What this proves, and what it does not

- It proves the **kernel copy-up mechanism**: a store write in one session's
  overlay upper cannot reach the shared base or another session.
- It does **not** implement or test the orchestrator **verify-and-admit** step
  (fetch a tarball by key, match the hash, re-derive the manifest, admit to a
  new base generation). The base here is a **warmed fixture** — a normal pnpm
  install — standing in for where the verified base would sit; it is not the
  proposed independent verification.
- Sessions mount only their own `/store` overlay plus a shared metadata-cache
  dir, not the backing directory, so a session cannot reach the base or other
  uppers by path. Production **mount confinement, immutable generations, and
  admission remain separate obligations** this harness does not discharge.

## Result: the overlay isolates the store-index attack (H4 and H2)

Verified base = a warmed store as the overlay **lowerdir**; attacker A and
victim B each mount base + their own **upper/work**. Each attack has its own
cell and its own no-overlay control.

| Cell | Overlay (A attacks, B installs) | No-overlay control (shared bind) |
|---|---|---|
| **H4** — rewrite `index.db` manifest to a poison blob at a valid hash | base `index.db` byte-unchanged; A's rewrite in A's upper; **B clean (digest matches original)** | **B poisoned** (`PWNED`, digest differs) |
| **H2** — poison the blob's bytes in place, **mtime preserved** (asserted `MT_OLD==MT_NEW`) | base unchanged; **B clean (digest matches)** | **B poisoned** (`POISON`, digest differs) |

The control is the load-bearing half: the same attack **poisons B on a shared
bind**, so the attack is real and the overlay copy-up is what stops it. Both
attacks succeed (H4 rewrote 1 manifest row; H2's `MT_OLD==MT_NEW` shows
deliberate mtime preservation, not timing luck), so the isolation is not a
false positive from an attack that quietly did nothing.

The topology this sits on — a `type=overlay` volume mounting at a subpath,
copy-up isolation, a shared base without EBUSY — is green on this host
(`docs/183-overlay-dep-store/prototype/nested-overlay-spike.sh`, 14/14).

## Measured disk — with the copied node_modules, which the store does NOT share

`du -sb` reports **apparent** bytes, not allocated blocks. `node_modules` is
**copied per session** (`package-import-method=copy`, a prerequisite for the
store-in-overlay move) and is **not** shared by the store lowerdir.

| Measurement | Value |
|---|---|
| base store (2 packages) | 1,117,294 B; `index.db` 8,192 B (0.7%) |
| `index.db` at scale (8 deps, 2,168 files, 51 MB store) | 659,456 B (1.3% **for this workload**) |
| A store-upper after the H4 attack | 25,119 B |
| B store-upper after a base-hit install | 49,152 B |
| B **node_modules** (base-hit, copied per session) | 54,457 B |
| new-package store-upper | 116,352 B |
| new-package node_modules | 36,096 B |

## Neither req 7 nor req 10 is established by these numbers

- **Req 10 is not established.** These figures show the store-upper copy-up is
  small (`index.db` plus any poisoned blob) and that `index.db` is ~1.3% of the
  store **for this one workload** — but a per-runtime index grows across
  repositories, so its absolute copy-up cost can grow independently of a
  session's own dependency set. More importantly, **every install copies a fresh
  `node_modules`** (54 KB even for the unchanged base-hit set here); the store
  lowerdir does not share those copies. Req 10 is about **total per-session
  allocated disk versus today's hardlink topology** — store, installed trees,
  uppers, retained generations — measured in allocated blocks, not apparent
  bytes. That comparison is **not** made here. The copied-`node_modules` cost is
  the same req-10 tension section 3's ext4 gate already flags.
- **Req 7 is not established.** The timing compares one tiny two-package install
  on an overlay store against the same install on a plain store — **both copy**,
  so it measures incremental overlay overhead (0.31 s vs 0.35 s, single-shot,
  container spawn included), **not** the change from today's hardlink installs.
  A req-7 verdict needs repeated representative installs timed against the
  current hardlink baseline.

## Finding: offline resolution needs metadata separate from the store

pnpm keeps **resolution metadata** (`<name>.jsonl`) in `XDG_CACHE_HOME/pnpm`,
**separate** from the `--store-dir`. A fresh session with an empty metadata
cache fails to *resolve* a name (`Failed to resolve <pkg> in package mirror`)
even when the store holds the content. Ways it works, and the design must pick
deliberately: a lockfile carrying the applicable resolution (need not be
committed, only present); a metadata cache the session can read — shared, or
privately seeded/copied from a trusted source; or a normal online fetch. The
harness shares the metadata cache; it does not run the empty-cache or
lockfile-only comparisons. The integrity implication stands: session-writable
resolution metadata is its own surface — verifying store *content* does not
authenticate which content a name should *select* (the req 6 class).

## Faithfulness and limits

- **The install copies, not hardlinks**, because `node_modules` (container fs)
  and the store (volume) are different filesystems — the same crossing the real
  design forces (store in an overlay, `node_modules` outside it), which is why
  `package-import-method=copy` is a prerequisite (plan.md section 2). This means
  the timing does **not** capture the hardlink→copy transition.
- **Concurrency is not a lock-correctness test.** Two installs into two separate
  uppers over one base both succeed, but each session writes its **own**
  `index.db` in its **own** upper — there is no shared writable index to lock.
  This shows separate-upper installs do not error; it does not establish lock
  correctness over a shared critical section.
- **Wall times include container spawn** and are single-shot.

## Reproduce

```
scp docs/276-shared-package-cache-integrity/store-overlay-spike.sh <docker-host>:/tmp/
ssh <docker-host> bash /tmp/store-overlay-spike.sh   # PASS=13 FAIL=0, exit 0
```

Needs only Docker on the host; the node + python toolchain comes from a baked
image. It cleans up its volumes on exit.
