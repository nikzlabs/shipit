# Present tool — render files in the Present tab

The `present` tool displays self-contained files to the user in ShipIt's
dedicated **Present** tab — an HTML page, an SVG diagram, a rendered markdown
doc, a chart, or an image. You **write the file first** (with the `Write`
tool), then call `present` with its path.

**Each call presents one file, but multiple presentations coexist in the tab.**
The Present tab is a carousel, and **the file path is the identity**:

- Present a **new path** → a new entry is appended.
- Present the **same path again** → that entry updates in place (this is how you
  iterate — edit the file and re-present it; no version flag).

So when you produce several artifacts the user should compare — three
landing-page variants, a before/after pair, a set of charts — **present them
all**: write each to its own file and call `present` once per file. Don't show a
single variant and point the user elsewhere for the rest; that limitation
doesn't exist.

## Throwaway vs. tracked — it's just where you write the file

`present` renders whatever file you point it at. The path's location is the
only thing that decides whether the artifact is throwaway or kept:

- **Throwaway** — write the file under **`/persist`** (e.g.
  `/persist/chart.html`). It never enters the workspace, the file tree, or git,
  but it **survives container restarts**, so the user still sees it tomorrow. Use
  this for quick diagrams, mockups, and previews the user only needs to look at.
  This is the default home for presented artifacts.
- **Tracked** — write the file **into the workspace** (e.g.
  `docs/mockups/landing.html`). It shows up in the file tree, gets
  auto-committed like any other file, **and** renders in the Present tab. Use
  this when the prototype is a deliverable you want reviewed in the PR.

There is no separate flag — pick the directory that matches your intent.

## When to use `present` vs `Write` alone

- Use **`present`** when you want the user to *see* a rendered visual: write
  the file, then present it. Works for both throwaway (`/persist`) and tracked
  (workspace) files.
- Use **`Write` alone** for files that don't need rendering — source code,
  configuration, tests, plain documentation. These are deliverables; they
  don't belong in the Present tab.

## Presenting multiple artifacts at once

There is **no one-at-a-time limit**. Each `present` call shows one file, and a
new path appends to the carousel, so showing N distinct artifacts is just N
calls — each to its own file:

```
// Three design variants, all shown together in the Present tab
// (after writing each file)
present({ file: "/persist/variant-a.html", title: "Variant A — minimal" })
present({ file: "/persist/variant-b.html", title: "Variant B — bold" })
present({ file: "/persist/variant-c.html", title: "Variant C — playful" })
// → three entries the user can flip between
```

Give each a distinct `title` so the carousel headings tell them apart. Add vs.
update is decided entirely by the path:

- **Add** another artifact → present a **different file path** (new entry).
- **Update** an artifact in place → present the **same file path** again after
  editing it (the iteration loop; the entry refreshes and keeps its slot).

So make distinct artifacts distinct files. If you reuse one path for a genuinely
different artifact, it *replaces* the previous one rather than adding alongside.

## Parameters

```json
{
  "file": "/persist/architecture.html",
  "title": "Architecture Diagram"
}
```

- **`file`** (required) — path to the file to present. Relative paths resolve
  against the workspace (your cwd); absolute paths (e.g. `/persist/chart.html`)
  are read as-is. Write the file before calling `present`. **The path is the
  identity**: re-presenting the same path updates that entry; a new path adds one.
- **`mimeType`** — optional override. By default the MIME type is **inferred
  from the file extension**: `.html`/`.htm` → `text/html`, `.svg` →
  `image/svg+xml`, `.md`/`.markdown` → `text/markdown`, `.png` → `image/png`,
  `.jpg`/`.jpeg` → `image/jpeg`, `.gif` → `image/gif`, `.webp` →
  `image/webp`. Unknown extensions fall back to `text/plain`.
- **`title`** — a short human-friendly **name** for the artifact, shown as the
  heading in the Present tab (e.g. "Sales Chart v2"). The tab header always
  shows the **full file path** beneath it; `title` is the friendly name on top.
  Optional — without it the header uses the file's name — but helpful when you
  present multiple artifacts in a session.

`present` returns `{ status, viewUrl }`. `viewUrl` serves the rendered artifact
for the screenshot loop below. There is no id to track: re-presenting the same
path is all it takes to update an entry, so the tool surfaces only the URL you
screenshot.

## Behavior

- HTML and SVG render inside a sandboxed iframe (`sandbox="allow-scripts"`)
  — JavaScript runs but the content can't read parent cookies, storage,
  or navigate the top frame.
- Markdown renders with the same renderer used elsewhere in ShipIt.
- Images render as `<img>`. The worker reads the file's bytes and encodes
  them, so you point `present` at the image file directly — no need to inline
  a data URI yourself.

## Iterating on visual artifacts (screenshot loop)

`present` returns `{ status, viewUrl }`. `viewUrl` is a worker-local URL
(e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:9100/present-files/pres_abc...`) that serves the exact
rendered artifact. Use it to *see your own output* and fix it before the user
has to:

1. Write the file, then call `present({ file, title })`.
2. `browser_navigate` to the returned `viewUrl`, then `browser_take_screenshot`.
3. Look for layout breaks, clipped SVG `viewBox`, overflow, low contrast, or a
   chart that rendered empty because its inline JS threw — defects you only
   catch by looking at the pixels.
4. Edit the file and call `present` again **with the same `file` path** to
   update it in place — because the path is the identity, the carousel entry
   refreshes and keeps its slot (no id to pass back, no version flag).
   The user sees each revision land in the Present tab as you iterate.
   **Re-presenting is also how you reload** — there is no live file watcher;
   call `present` again after editing the file.
5. Re-navigate to the same `viewUrl` and screenshot again to confirm the fix.
   (`viewUrl` is stable across re-presents of the same path, so it stays valid.)

This is the same browser you use for live previews — nothing new to set up. The
artifact renders in real Chromium, so what you screenshot is what the user sees.
If a navigate returns 404, the file is no longer on disk — just call `present`
again to get a fresh URL.

**Always screenshot `viewUrl`, never the file directly** (no `file://`, no
opening the path in the browser). `viewUrl` runs the same renderer as the user's
Present tab — it converts markdown to HTML, wraps SVG zero-margin, and decodes
images. The raw file does none of that, so a screenshot of it would not match
what the user sees and would defeat the point of the check.

## Limits

- No artifact-size or count caps. A presentation always shows, no matter how
  large, and every artifact of the session stays in the carousel.
- The worker keeps only the file's PATH, not its bytes — they're read from disk
  on demand whenever the artifact is served (your screenshot `viewUrl`, the
  user's Present tab). So the file must still exist when it's viewed: a
  `/persist` throwaway and a workspace file both survive as long as they're on
  disk. If you overwrite or delete the file, the next view reflects that.
  Re-present (or write the file again) to restore it.
- Present-tab artifacts **persist across a reload, a session switch, and a
  container restart** — their metadata is saved durably on the orchestrator (not
  in the container), and the bytes are re-read from the source file on demand.
  Both tiers re-render fully after the container is recycled: a **tracked
  workspace file** is still on disk (re-cloned from git), and a **`/persist`
  throwaway** survives because `/persist` is host-backed and re-mounted. (A file
  written to a truly ephemeral, non-persistent location would be gone after a
  restart and show a graceful "source no longer available" placeholder — which is
  exactly why presented artifacts go to `/persist`.) The Present tab is only fully
  wiped on a session delete / full reset.
- There is no user-facing "save" button. A `/persist` throwaway already survives
  restarts; if the user wants it **committed to the repo**, they'll ask you to
  write it into the workspace — just `present` a file you've written there.

## Examples

```
// Throwaway diagram — write to /persist, present, never touches git
// (survives a container restart; after Write to /persist/component-graph.svg)
present({ file: "/persist/component-graph.svg", title: "Component graph" })
// → { status: "presented", viewUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:9100/present-files/pres_abc..." }
```

```
// Tracked mockup — write into the workspace so it's committed AND rendered
// (after Write to docs/mockups/release-notes.md)
present({ file: "docs/mockups/release-notes.md", title: "Draft release notes" })
```

```
// Update a mockup in place: edit the SAME file, then re-present it.
// Same path → same entry refreshes (no replaceId, no version flag).
// (after editing /persist/landing.html)
present({ file: "/persist/landing.html", title: "Landing page v2" })
```

```
// Show several distinct artifacts at once: one call per file (distinct paths).
present({ file: "/persist/variant-a.html", title: "Variant A" })
present({ file: "/persist/variant-b.html", title: "Variant B" })
```
